This is the repository for the code of the *UniversEat* app that I, together with some other students, have developed as a university project for an exam.

This repository is an exact public copy of the private repository we used during development.

# Purpose
The goal of the project was to develop an Android application that could help students to find a place nearby the university where they could eat.

Owners of the food shop can put up menus and offers for the students to see.

Students can follow their favourite food shop and receive notifications on when a new menu/dish is inserted. They can also receive notifications of when their order is ready. Likewise, shop owners receive notifications of orders to process.
